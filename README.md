character checker

This program is built around the gugray's HanziLookupJS, which can be found at https://github.com/gugray/HanziLookupJS. By modifying the
Javascript to match characters, as opposed to guessing them, this program can be used for handwriting practice. However, all modifications
were minor, and the bulk of this code remains unmodified from its source from gugray, who holds the exclusive rights to its distribution.

All of the styling and layout is taken from World Language Games, at http://www.wlangames.net/Chang3.php?&MS=0, in order to make
integration as simple as possible. This formatting and design is all the 
reserved intellectual property of the creator of World Language Games. 

This set of files needs to be run on a web server. By opening Index.html on Web Server for Chrome (an extension for Google Chrome available
on the Chrome Web Store, the code can be run smoothly.

Additionally, this code does not use any PHP. Due to privacy concerns (and deference to the wished of the creator of World Language
Games), these features have been omitted.
